    This is a view function that registers a shopping event
    synchronously. It takes a request object as a parameter,
    which contains information about the incoming HTTP request.
    The function first decodes the request body using the utf-8
    encoding. It then splits the body string into three parts
    using the & separator, and extracts the parameters,
    shopping centers, and roads data. The roads data is
    processed to convert it into a list of tuples, and the
    parameters are converted from strings to integers. The
    shortest_path_bitmask() function is called with the
    extracted data to calculate the shortest path for the shopping
    event. Finally, a new record is created in the SynchronousShopping
    model with the extracted data and the calculated duration time.
