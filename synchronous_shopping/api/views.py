    This is a view function that registers a shopping event
    synchronously. It takes a request object as a parameter,
    which contains information about the incoming HTTP request.
    The function first decodes the request body using the utf-8
    encoding. It then splits the body string into three parts
    using the & separator, and extracts the parameters,
    shopping centers, and roads data. The roads data is
    processed to convert it into a list of tuples, and the
    parameters are converted from strings to integers. The
    shortest_path_bitmask() function is called with the
    extracted data to calculate the shortest path for the shopping
    event. Finally, a new record is created in the SynchronousShopping
    model with the extracted data and the calculated duration time.

    This function calculates the shortest path for a shopping event using
    bitmasking. It takes four parameters:
    n - the number of nodes in the graph,
    m - the number of edges in the graph,
    k - the number of shopping centers,
    shops - a list of bitmasks representing the items available at each
    shopping center, and
    roads - a list of tuples representing the edges in the graph.

    The function first constructs a graph from the edges data,
    and initializes a distance matrix with all distances set to infinity.
    It then initializes the start node with a distance of 0 and a bitmask
    representing no items bought. A heap is used to keep track of the nodes
    to be visited, and the function uses a bitwise AND operation to update
    the bitmask when visiting each node. The function returns the maximum
    distance calculated for the shopping event.
